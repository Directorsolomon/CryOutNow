# CryOutNow Development Roadmap

## 1. UI/UX Design & User Flow

### Refine Layout & Navigation
- [x] Implement a clean top navigation bar with clear calls to action (e.g., "View Prayer Requests", "Get Started", "Login", "Register")
- [x] Ensure a responsive design that adapts for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [x] Simplify page headings and use clear subheadings for readability

### Consistent Branding & Typography
- [x] Define a consistent color palette (e.g., primary, secondary, accent) aligned with your brand style
- [x] Apply consistent typography—select 2–3 complementary fonts (one for headings, one for body text)
- [x] Use ample whitespace to avoid clutter and give elements room to breathe

### Best Practice UI Elements
- [x] Use consistent button styles (primary vs. secondary) with clear text labels
- [x] Employ card-based layouts for prayer requests, emphasizing titles, tags, and like/comment counts
- [x] Incorporate a clear, prominent call-to-action (CTA) on the homepage (e.g., "Post a Prayer Request")

### User Flow
- [x] Onboarding: Simple registration flow (email/password or social login)
- [x] Posting Requests: Straightforward form for users to add prayer requests (title, description, tags)
- [x] Interaction: Ability to like, comment, or share each prayer request
- [x] Profile Management: Option for users to update their profile, view their posted requests, and manage notifications (if needed)

## 2. Firebase Setup & Configuration

### Create Firebase Project
- [x] Initialize a new Firebase project on Firebase Console
- [x] Register your web app to retrieve your Firebase config

### Environment & Security
- [x] Store Firebase config keys in environment files (e.g., .env in React)
- [x] Configure security rules for Firestore to ensure only authenticated users can write to prayer requests

### Firestore Database Structure
#### Collections
- [x] users
- [x] prayerRequests

#### Documents
- [x] users/{userId} (profile info, metadata)
- [x] prayerRequests/{requestId} (title, description, tags, userId, createdAt, likes, etc.)

#### Subcollections
- [x] comments under each prayerRequests/{requestId}

### Authentication
- [x] Enable Email/Password Auth (optionally add social providers like Google or Facebook)
- [x] Configure sign-up, login, and logout flows in your React app

### Hosting
- [x] Complete your production build of React
- [x] Deploy via firebase deploy to your custom domain or project-id.web.app

## 3. Frontend Implementation (React)

### File/Folder Structure
- [x] src/: Main folder for React source code
- [x] components/: Shared UI elements (cards, buttons, inputs)
- [x] pages/: Page-level components (Home, Login, Register, PrayerRequests, etc.)
- [x] context/: React Context (e.g., AuthContext) to handle user state throughout the app
- [x] services/: Firebase interaction logic (auth methods, Firestore queries)
- [x] styles/: Global styles, theme variables, or CSS modules

### UI Components
- [x] Create reusable components (e.g., <Card />, <Button />, <Input />)
- [x] Implement error/success states in forms, with relevant UI feedback

### Authentication Flow
- [x] Redirect authenticated users away from the login/register pages
- [x] Protect routes (e.g., "Add Prayer Request") from unauthenticated access

### Firestore Data Handling
- [x] CRUD operations for prayer requests (Create, Read, Update, Delete) if needed
- [x] Real-time updates for likes/comments (use Firestore's real-time listeners)

### Performance & Accessibility
- [x] Lazy-load content (if beneficial) for faster initial loads
- [x] Use ARIA labels and follow WCAG guidelines for better accessibility

## 4. Quality Assurance & Testing

### UI Testing
- [x] Verify mobile responsiveness on multiple screen sizes
- [x] Test each form (Login, Register, Post Prayer Request) for validation errors and success states

### Security & Permissions
- [x] Confirm Firestore rules block unauthorized read/write requests
- [x] Test user roles if you have admin or special privileges

### Cross-Browser Checks
- [x] Perform testing on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge

## 5. Deployment & Post-Launch

### Firebase Hosting
- [x] Complete your production build of React
- [x] Deploy via firebase deploy to your custom domain or project-id.web.app

### Monitoring & Logs
- [x] Enable Firebase Analytics or an alternative to track user engagement
- [x] Set up error monitoring (e.g., track console errors or use third-party services)

### Continuous Improvement
- [ ] Gather user feedback and refine your UI and functionalities accordingly
- [ ] Schedule periodic code reviews to maintain best practices and code cleanliness

## 6. Final Review
- [ ] Confirm each feature meets user needs and is free of major bugs
- [ ] Verify design consistency (colors, fonts, spacing)
- [ ] Ensure the Firebase backend is secure, scalable, and well-structured
- [ ] Complete final deployment and mark the project as "Production Ready"
